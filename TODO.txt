# TYPOS and Suggestins from David Corwin:

Dear William Stein,
 
Thank you for providing your textbook online. I like it because it provides intuitive introductions to more advanced topics such as quadratic forms, ideal class groups, and elliptic curves (and the relation between the first two) without getting too advanced. I find that reading such a text makes it all the much easier when one actually proceeds to learn the material in a more advanced course.
 
I have a couple corrections/questions/suggestions to make. First, when defining the discriminant of a number field, I notice the notation ' symbol appears next to a gamma without having been introduced. I believe this means the conjugate?
 
Second, in example 9.5.11, you mention Q[sqrt(-20)], but it doesn't make sense why you don't just write Q[sqrt(-5)]. The discriminant of this field is -5 since 5=1 mod 4. And it seems like, if a field has discriminant d, then the correspondence is with the quadratic forms of discriminant d. But on Theorem 9.4.4, it says that -20, not -5, has class number 2, so I'm a bit confused?
 
Finally, my main suggestion is simply to add a little more material. I think the intuitive style makes the content very understandable, so for example: What about ideal class groups for higher dimensional number fields? What is the connection to Galois theory? Maybe a little more on modular forms, such as their connection to quadratic forms (which makes a lot of sense given that you introduced the action of the modular group on quadratic forms). Also, maybe something about analytic number theory or ideal density might be nice. One other suggestion is that the "heuristic argument" be moved closer to the beginning of the chapter on computing with elliptic curves.
 
 
# notes

* define ideal after defining ring and module.

* after defn 4.1.2 (noetherian) should say that M is noetherian.

* in proof of prop 4.1.4 1=>2, should have Moo instead of M in
a few places.

* say what "maximal" means (i.e., nothing is > it).

* otherwise "M1 would be maximal"

* in lemma 4.1.7, note that it's an exact sequence of R-modules,
  where S gets an R-module structure from phi.

* in proof of hilbert basis:   
    - define "leading coefficient":
           coefficient of highest degree term, e.g., 
              3x^7 + 5x^2  - 4 has leading coefficient 3.
    - if a,b in I with a+b =/= 0 ... reads confusingly, since condition
      that a+b=/= 0 is not required.
    - make the a_i that generate I nonzero.
    - "and the a_j are in I" should be "... in A", no?
    - "The module S<d is submodule"  (missing article)
    - "The S<d is a finitely generated R-module"
    - "Suppose g in I is arbitrary".  Rephrase this whole induction, which
      is done in a REALLY BAD way at present.  Just prove by induction
      that every g in I is a combination of fi's and gi's.  Induct on 
      the degree of an element.  Do base case -- degree 0.  Then do
      general case --- given g of degree n, suppose know statement for
      all elements of I of degree < n, by degree < d and >= d.
      Degree 0:  without loss, chose the d above to be >= 1.  
    - 

* chapter on rings of integers: 
    - Qbar "could be the subfield ..." --> one model of Qbar is...
    - "much of this course" --> "... book"

* in defn of min poly require degree is positive.

* give examples right after defn of algebraic number, and min poly.

* "however, f is the poly of least deg" ; use that poly is monic.

* exercise -- use that Q[x] is a pid to show that min poly is uniq.
